# Predictive-Maintenance-Model-using-Machine-Learning
Developed a predictive maintenance model using machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forest) to analyze sensor data from 1,000+ industrial machines. Achieved a predictive accuracy of 90%, reducing potential downtime by 20% through early detection of equipment failures.
